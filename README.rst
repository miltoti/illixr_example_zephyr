Example for Illixr. SHould be able to add it as an example under /zephyr/samples.

To run, go to your zephyr directory, source the appropriate environment, and build.

The command used is: ```west build -p -b spike_riscv64 samples/illixr_working/ -DYAML_FILE=profiles/default_new.yaml```

After that, can run spike accordingly.
